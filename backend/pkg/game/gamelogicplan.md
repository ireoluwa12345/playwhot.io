## Implementation Plan for Whot Game Logic

Based on your current codebase and the game rules, here's my comprehensive plan:

### High Priority Items:

1. Update Card struct - Add fields to identify special card types and their effects
2. Special card enums - Create constants for Hold On (1), Pick Two (2), Pick Three (5), Suspension
(8)
3. Complete PlayCard method - Implement all game rules including special card effects
4. Add IsValidPlay method - Check if cards match by number or symbol, handle Whot wild cards
5. Whot card special effects - Wild card functionality, cancel pick cards, suit selection

### Medium Priority Items:

6. NextTurn method - Handle turn rotation, suspension skips, direction changes
7. CheckWinCondition method - Detect when player runs out of cards
8. DrawCard method - Handle drawing when player can't play

### Low Priority Items:

9. Scoring system - Star card double values, end-game scoring
10. Card announcements - "Semi Last Card" and "Last Card" logic

### Key Features to Implement:

• Special Card Effects:
 • Hold On (1): Player gets another turn
 • Pick Two (2): Next player draws 2 cards
 • Pick Three (5): Next player draws 3 cards
 • Suspension (8): Next player misses turn
 • Whot: Wild card, cancels pick cards, chooses suit
• Game Flow:
 • Deal 6 cards (update from current 4)
 • Match by number or symbol
 • Draw if can't play
 • Win by emptying hand
